""" Exercise 2: Simple Sums

In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arith-
metic operations, and print the result to the console.

Steps:
1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value 8.
2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value 10.
3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
4. Print the value of the sum to the console.
"""
#Initializing 8 to variable Num1
Num1=8
#Initializing 10 to variable Num2
Num2=10
#Concatenating both variables
Sum=Num1+Num2
print("The sum of 8+10=",Sum)
