#Exercise 7: Some Counting
""" Use your newly acquired knowledge of the for loop to complete the following
tasks. Print all values to the console in each case. * Write a loop that counts
up from 0 to 50 in increments of 1. * Write a loop that counts down from 50 to
0 in decrements of 1. * Write a loop that counts up from 30 to 50 in increments
of 1. * Write a loop that counts down from 50 to 10 in decrements of 2. * Write
a loop that counts up from 100 to 200 in increments of 5. You may include all
loops in a single project """
